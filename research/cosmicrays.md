# Imaging Applications of Cosmic Rays 

Cosmic rays are particles that rain down on the Earth's surface and have proved tremendously useful in an analogous manner to medical X-rays. When an x-ray radiograph is taken, changes in tissue and bone materials stop differing proportions of x-rays. These variations in x-ray intensity are measured by an x-ray detector or image plate that reveals information about the structure underneath the skin's surface.
