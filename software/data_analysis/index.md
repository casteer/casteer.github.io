## Simple Command-line Data Analysis Programs

### A Flexible Histogram Program

Histograms are a visual way of displaying the frequency at which a particular data value occurs in a number of measurements. Whilst I realise that there are many the general data analysis programs, such as ROOT or Matlab, I was looking for a challenge and really a data analysis exercise to use the C++ standard template library and perform a flexible histogram program. An additional benefit of this stripped back approach was that the compiled programe runs successfully on the command-line, permitting the piping of a program that is generating the data into the histogram program. The result of this exercise is the program histogram.cpp.
