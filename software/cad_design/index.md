# Computer-Aided Design

I just like building, making and testing sensors and mechnical curiousities. 

## An automatic artificial muscle winding system

This was inspired by a previous design with a video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMMGfzYXwAU). So there seem to be a few stages to the production: 

1. Winding heater wire around the pre-wound nylon filament
2. Twisting the nylon filament to induce coiling

I was interested in the artificial muscle itself and less so about integrating the heater wire around the filament (maybe at a later iteration). So I started to sketch the design focussing on step 2, the twisting of the nylon filament to induce the coiling.

The design is based in the cloud at [OnShape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/d8cfb3fe114fd1b4f46390e4/w/83a8605fd9dbd7406fb6c8f0/e/be26834f6866e28efb1d0bc9)
