Octopus arms and elephant trunks are both examples of muscular hydrostats; these natural appendages are composed of purely muscles that have a constant volume, flexing to will but maintaining the overall shape of the arm or trunk. 

A man-made robotic analogue of muscular hydrostats is the continuum arm, comprising flexible sections that move when tendons are pulled.
