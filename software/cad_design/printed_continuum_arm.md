## A 3D Printed Continuum Arm

Octopus arms and elephant trunks are both examples of muscular hydrostats; these natural appendages are composed of purely muscles that have a constant volume, flexing to will but maintaining the overall shape of the arm or trunk. 

Continuum robotic arms are inspired in part by the natural soft-tissue, muscular arms of cephalapods and have found many applications in areas such as automobile manfacture, space exploration, medical and security.
