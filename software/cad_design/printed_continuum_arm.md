## A 3D Printed Continuum Arm

Continuum robotic arms are inspired in part by the natural soft-tissue, muscular arms of cephalapods and have found many applications in areas such as automobile manfacture, space exploration, medical and security.

### Design 

The design of the 3D printed arm owes alot to the work of the King's College group [[1]](). The arm is composed of sections with a sprung platform in the centre. The sprung platform is then connected to the next section, enabling a flexible joint.
